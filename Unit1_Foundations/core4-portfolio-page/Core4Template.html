  <h2 style="color:black;font-family:verdana;text-align:center;"> All about me! </h2>
  <p> Welcome to my website. My name is Catalina Lemus. I was born on October 26, 2000 in Bogota, Colombia. I am currently going to be a Junior in the fall, and I attend Auburn Riverside High School.</p>

  <h3 style="color:black;font-family:verdana;text-align:center;"> Fishy World </h3>
  <p> "Fishy World" is a game a group of friends and I designed at Girls Who Code. The goal of the game is to feed our little fishy friend while steering clear of the dangerous puffer fish. </p>

  <h3 style="color:black;font-family:verdana;text-align:center;"> Reflection </h3>
  <h4 style="color:black;font-family:verdana;text-align:center;"> Accessibility </h4>
  <p> I have adapted my website in many ways striving to make it user-friendly and accessible to all. One of the ways I have attempted to do this is by declaring the language of my website. This will allow for people that use screen readers to have a better experience. I have also added the "alt" attribute which gives a small description of the picture displayed so that screen readers can read them outloud. This attribute can also benefit people that have a slow internet connection. </p>
  <h4 style="color:black;font-family:verdana;text-align:center;"> Other People </h4>
  <p> I like the way many of the girls in the group organized their websites and also created a color palette for the site. </p>
  <h4 style="color:black;font-family:verdana;text-align:center;"> I am proud of...</h4>
  <p> Normally i have a lot of difficulty learning on my own so I am very proud that i was able to go throught the HTML tutorial and teach myself the skills necessary to make my own website. </p>
